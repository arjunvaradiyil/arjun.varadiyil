      <h2>Introduction to MERN Stack</h2>
      <p>The MERN stack is a powerful combination of technologies that enables developers to build modern, scalable web applications. It consists of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MongoDB</strong> - A NoSQL database for flexible data storage</li>
        <li><strong>Express.js</strong> - A web application framework for Node.js</li>
        <li><strong>React</strong> - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces</li>
        <li><strong>Node.js</strong> - A JavaScript runtime for server-side development</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Why Choose MERN?</h2>
      <p>The MERN stack offers several advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full-stack JavaScript development</li>
        <li>Large and active community</li>
        <li>Rich ecosystem of libraries and tools</li>
        <li>Excellent for rapid prototyping and development</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>To begin your MERN stack journey, start by setting up your development environment and understanding each component of the stack.</p>
