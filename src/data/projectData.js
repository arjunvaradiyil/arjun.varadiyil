    about:
      "This is my B.Tech final year project - an innovative mobile application designed to assist deaf and mute individuals in communication. The application was developed using the Flutter framework and integrates MediaPipe for real-time gesture recognition. I implemented advanced real-time gesture recognition algorithms that can interpret sign language gestures, and sophisticated text-to-speech conversion features that enable users to communicate effectively. The project combines mobile development, machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing to create a comprehensive communication support system.",
    challenges:
      "The major challenges included implementing real-time gesture recognition with high accuracy, integrating multiple AI/ML technologies seamlessly, and ensuring the application works reliably across different devices and lighting conditions.",
    solutions:
      "I used MediaPipe for robust gesture recognition and integrated TensorFlow models for machine learning capabilities. Python was used for backend processing, while Flutter provided a cross-platform mobile solution. Computer vision algorithms were implemented to accurately detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time, and natural language processing was used to convert text to speech effectively.",

    about:
      "This project is a comprehensive event scheduling platform built using the MERN stack. The application features real-time overlap prevention and conflict resolution to ensure efficient event management. I implemented a robust user authentication system with role-based access control and secure session management to protect data access. The platform allows users to schedule events while preventing conflicts and overlaps, making it ideal for managing busy calendars and event coordination.",
    challenges:
      "The major challenges included implementing real-time overlap detection and conflict resolution algorithms, ensuring secure authentication with role-based access control, and managing session state effectively across the application.",
    solutions:
      "I developed algorithms to detect and prevent event overlaps in real-time, ensuring no scheduling conflicts occur. JWT-based authentication was implemented with role-based access control to secure different user roles. RESTful APIs were used for efficient data communication, and secure session management was implemented to protect user data throughout the application lifecycle.",
