      "Carelabs is a professional training and lab-based learning platform. This project involved redesigning and rebuilding their existing website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, with Strapi as the headless CMS. The platform was rebuilt to support large-scale content management and country-specific pages, while maintaining a consistent brand identity across regions.",

    about:
      "For Carelabs, I worked on the complete redesign and redevelopment of their existing corporate website, rebuilding it from the ground up using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. I was responsible for developing the entire frontend and integrating it with a Strapi headless CMS using GraphQL and Apollo Client. A major part of the project involved designing a scalable content architecture to support country-specific pages, where each country had its own content, navigation, and page structure while still maintaining a unified codebase and brand identity. To achieve this, I implemented dynamic routing and data-driven page rendering in Next.js, allowing content to be fully managed from Strapi without hardcoding pages. I also focused on performance optimization, responsive design, and clean component architecture to ensure maintainability and future scalability. The final outcome was a modern, fast, and flexible website that significantly improved content management, scalability, and overall user experience compared to the previous version.",
    challenges:
      "A major challenge was handling country-specific content within a single website. Each country had its own set of pages, navigation structure, and content requirements, all managed from the same CMS. Structuring Strapi to support this level of flexibility without duplicating content or complicating frontend logic was a key technical challenge.",
    solutions:
      "We redesigned the CMS architecture in Strapi using structured content types, relations, and dynamic zones to manage country-specific data efficiently. On the frontend, Next.js dynamic routing combined with GraphQL queries enabled seamless rendering of localized pages. Apollo Client handled optimized data fetching and caching, resulting in a scalable and maintainable solution.",
