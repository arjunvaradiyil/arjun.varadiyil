# How to Remove Outdated Content from Google Search

## The Issue
You're seeing an outdated search result from bold.pro showing "Arjun Varadiyil - Storekeeper - Lulu Hypermarket" which is incorrect information.

**Problematic URL:** https://ae.bold.pro/my/arjun-varadiyil-250906220936

## ⚠️ Important Limitation

**Google Search Console only allows you to remove URLs from properties you own.** Since bold.pro is a third-party site, you **cannot** remove it directly through Google Search Console. You'll get an error: "URL not in property".

## Solutions

### Option 1: Contact Bold.pro Directly (RECOMMENDED)

This is the most effective way to permanently remove or update the incorrect information:

1. **Visit Bold.pro Support:**
   - Go to: https://bold.pro
   - Look for "Contact Us", "Support", or "Help" section
   - Or email: support@bold.pro (if available)

2. **Request Profile Removal/Update:**
   - Explain that the profile contains outdated/incorrect information
   - Request either:
     - Complete removal of your profile, OR
     - Update to reflect your current profession as "Web Developer"
   - Provide your profile URL: https://ae.bold.pro/my/arjun-varadiyil-250906220936

3. **If they have a profile management page:**
   - Try logging in to bold.pro with your email
   - Check if you can edit or delete your profile directly

### Option 2: Use Google's Public URL Removal Tool

If the content violates Google's policies (contains personal information, is defamatory, etc.):

1. Go to: https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6302812
2. Use the "Remove outdated content from Google Search" form
3. Enter the URL: https://ae.bold.pro/my/arjun-varadiyil-250906220936
4. Explain why it should be removed (outdated/incorrect information)

### Option 3: Improve Your Own SEO (Already Done ✅)

Your portfolio site now has:
- ✅ Enhanced structured data emphasizing "Web Developer" profession
- ✅ Clear job title and occupation schema
- ✅ Strong SEO metadata
- ✅ Proper sitemap and robots.txt

**This will help your portfolio site rank higher and push down the incorrect result over time.**

### Option 4: Request Removal via Google's Legal Process

If the content is defamatory or contains false information:

1. Visit: https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420
2. Submit a legal removal request if applicable

## Action Plan

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ **Contact Bold.pro support** - Request profile removal/update
2. ✅ **Submit Google's public removal request** - Use the outdated content form
3. ✅ **Monitor your search results** - Check weekly for changes

### Long-term Strategy:
1. ✅ **Continue building your portfolio site's authority**
2. ✅ **Create more content** (blog posts, projects) to improve SEO
3. ✅ **Build backlinks** to your portfolio site
4. ✅ **Maintain active social media profiles** (LinkedIn, GitHub) with correct information

## Expected Timeline

- **Bold.pro response:** 1-2 weeks (if they respond)
- **Google removal (if approved):** 1-4 weeks
